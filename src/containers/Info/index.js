    <h3>About Us , </h3> <br></br><br></br>"
    The country’s first-ever end-to-end fully-integrated online supermarket specializing in grocery was recently launched to cater to households all over Sri Lanka.
    
    The service intends to deliver groceries and other items swiftly, conveniently and safely to the doorstep. eGro is geared to offer a wide range of products to customers across categories of fresh, chilled, frozen and dry.
    
    Two veteran business personalities in the country have teamed up to launch eGro, to meet today’s need for high-quality, fast and reliable online grocery shopping and delivery services. True to the nature of ‘End to End’ supermarket concept, eGro will take care of each and every aspect of the service from warehousing, procurement, pricing, and product choice to home delivery.
    
    Spearheaded by Sidath Kodikara, former Chief Executive Officer of a leading retailing company in the country and former President of Sri Lanka Retailers’ Association (SLRA) and Dulith Herath, Founder of Kapruka.com, eGro will provide a wide-range of items from the fresh, chilled, frozen and dry categories.
    
    Strengthened by a tier-1 warehouse management system, world-class ERP solutions, a top tier e-commerce platform and unparalleled last-mile delivery by industry expert professional organizations, eGro plans to reach out to customers across the island. All purchases from eGro will be hygienically packed with strict guidelines to ensure safety and delivered in sealed boxes.
    
    In addition to serving customers living in Sri Lanka, eGro will offer a convenient service to Sri Lankan expatriates living around the world to send essentials, groceries and gifts to their friends and families at home.
    
    The two founders of eGro count over 20 years of experience in their respective industries (retail and e-commerce) — a fact that cemented the successful and steadfast nature of their new venture.
    
    “The COVID-19 pandemic fuelled the already steady growth of e-commerce in Sri Lanka. During the lockdown period, we witnessed the urgent requirement for a reliable, safe and fast supermarket service. Hence, we worked on the idea of creating the ideal solution to offer convenience, speed and safety to customers.
    
    “eGro is the product of our carefully mapped, well-researched and resourced work to create an online supermarket that will cater to the needs of Sri Lankans across the nation. While the pandemic triggered the change in consumer behaviour and increased reliance on e-commerce, we believe that this trend will continue beyond this period,” commented Dulith Herath.
    
    eGro will provide customers with an exceptionally wide range of products on a platform that is easy to navigate. In addition to other products available at supermarkets, eGro will provide a limited range of gourmet products and ensure the freshness of fruits and vegetables on offer.
    
    eGro has engaged a team of experienced industry professionals to serve customers with exceptional proficiency, insights and professionalism.
    
    “We believe that business ventures should transcend beyond mere profit to build social and environmental capital. Striving for environmentally friendly business practices and helping communities are essential ingredients in building a sustainable business. In forming eGro, we were committed to venture out to eco-friendly approaches. As such, packaging options with biodegradable material including banana stem fibre packaging. Moreover, we wish to help local industries during these challenging times. eGro products assortment will contain high-quality local cottage industry products, speciality imported products alongside other Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG),” commented Sidath Kodikara.
    
    Built for an online audience from the ground up, eGro is set to change the course of e-commerce in Sri Lanka.</div>
